# Article II: Membership

## 2.1 Eligibility

Membership in the Cerulean Pact is open to individuals who demonstrate exceptional skill and discretion in their chosen field of criminal activity, as well as members of government and commerce that recognize the need for an honorable form of crime. Prospective members must be sponsored by an existing member and approved by a majority vote of the Pact's leadership council.

## 2.1.1 Talent Discovery

While a sponsor is required for membership to the Pact, it is not required to request membership. This requested membership can be requested freely, with limitations to access and protections under the pact. This provisional membership can be used to attract the eye of an existing member in good standing to serve as a sponsor.

## 2.2 Rights and Responsibilities

Signed parties of the Pact are entitled to access its resources, protection, and support for their endeavors within the boundaries of the organization's principles. They are expected to abide by the code of conduct, maintain confidentiality regarding Pact affairs, and contribute to the collective success of the group.

## 2.2.1 Cost of Services

The Pact does not ensure an unlimited access to services without cost. Instead, it seeks to ensure a free market where those with the ability and skill can multiply their affect by having access to tools, information, and people that they otherwise would not be able to have access too. Additionally, this access should imply a higher level of trust and validity: while the Pact cannot guarantee a lack of disagreements or betrayals, they can deal harshly with those who act without honor, removing access to resources, and ensuring a fitting outcome to those who would betray the pact.

## 2.3 Termination

Membership may be terminated under three classes: voluntary, temporary, and forceful.

## 2.3.1 Voluntary Termination

At any time, a signer of the pact may request removal from the active roll. Their name will removed completely from the pact after a period of four tendays. Any debts with members or Pact leadership must be cleared during this time.
If a requester of voluntary termination acts in a way that violates the pact during that time, an emergency tribunal may be held to consider forceful termination, along with punishments. A former member who has been removed from the Pact in this way is free to return at any time, and will be treated as a new signer of the Pact.

## 2.3.2 Temporary Termination

Temporary termination may be enacted by a decision of the tribunal in cases of misconduct, unintentional transgression of Pact interests, or general violations of the code of conduct. This is an action used for punishment, and is best generalized as temporary removal of the privileges of the pact. While temporary terminated, the name of the terminated individual will be stricken through with a fading ink. For as long as their name is stricken, they are barred from receiving all benefits of membership, unless expressly granted access the council. See Article IV section 1 for more information on the leadership council. If such grant is given, it will be explicit and limited to what is stated.

## 2.3.3 Forceful Termination

Forceful termination may be enacted by a decision of the leadership council in cases such as, but not limited to: gross misconduct, betrayal of Pact interests, or repeated violations of the code of conduct. In this case, a members name is crossed through on the Pact, ensuring that they are known as a former member in bad standing. A forcefully terminated individual is treated as an enemy of the Pact, and may not request readmittance. Any signed party who continues to carry an association with such an individual may be considered for punishment.

## 2.4 Fees and Dues

Membership within the pact has no explicit fee for entry, nor a specific due. An individual may become a signed member of the Pact, assemble a crew of Pact members, and then leave after a job for no additional charge. Instead, the Pact will charge fees and dues via services offered. As a non-limiting example, if a member needs assistance in fencing an object, they can turn over that item to the Pact fencing service, which will take the responsibility for moving the object, and taking a nominal fee from the proceeds of the sale. A member looking for a new job may consult the Pact job acquisitions team for a regular flow of work. From the payment of a successful job, the Pact will receive a reasonable finders fee for providing the labor. Pact members may enroll in the retirement, insurance, or the legal services fund. Further details can be found in Article VI section 5.

## 2.4.1 Purpose of Fees and Dues

The Pact will use collected fees to provide the benefits described later in this Pact. Examples include, but are not limited to: augmentation of services available to members, selective investment into member business and endeavors, an insurance and disability fund, and legal protections. 

## 2.4.2 Accounting

Tribunals must submit records of payment to the leadership council. The council will control the budget in the best interest of Pact members. Only in exceptional circumstances may a tribunal authorize a payment or loan of more than 100GP without consulting the open signatory. A tribunal that exceeds this threshold may be considered for punishment. Further information on the open signatory is in Article IV section 2, subsection 1.
