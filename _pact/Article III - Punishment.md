# Article III: Punishment

## 3.1 Punishment

In cases of violation of the Pact, as determined by a tribunal, an individual will be liable to being punished by the terms of this pact.

## 3.2 Access to Benefits

During a period of punishment, an individual will be withheld from benefits of the Pact. This can include, but is not limited to: Access to Pact locales, allowance for free trade with Pact vendors and service providers, access to legal services, information brokerage, fencing, training, and any other services provided. This ban from Pact services is an independent duration, and is decided by a tribunal. An indefinite punishment period may be determined in instances where a tribunal needs additional time to determine a fitting punishment.

## 3.3 The Pact and the Judicial System

For severe violations of the Pact an individual may be turned over to the Watch to peacefully receive the punishments as dictated by the Waterdeep judiciary system. Upon the judgment of the Tribunal, legal representation may be available, or may be intentionally withheld, in accordance to the severity of the infractions, and level of punishment incurred.

## 3.4 Waiver of Punishment

For lesser transgressions, a tribunal may judge that the punishment can be completely waived in exchange for restitution payment and donations. Should the member be unable to pay these fees, a contract of debt and schedule of payment or services will be created. This will maintain the member of the Pact as a member in good standing, and provide a method of ensuring positive outcomes despite minor infractions or honest mistakes.
