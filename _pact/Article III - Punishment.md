3.1 Punishment: In cases of violation of the Pact, as determined by the tribunal, an individual will be liable to being punished by the terms of this pact.

3.2 Access to benefits: During a period of punishment, an individual will be withheld from benefits of the Pact. This can include, but is not limited to: Access to Pact locales, allowance for free trade with Pact vendors and service providers, Access to legal services, information brokerage, fencing, training, and any other services provided. This ban from Pact services is an independent duration, and is decided by Tribunal. An indefinite punishment period may be determined in instances where the Tribunal needs additional time to determine a fitting punishment.

3.3 The Pact and the Judicial System: In most cases where punishment is enacted, the individual will be turned over to the Watch to peacefully receive the punishments as dictated by the Waterdeep judiciary system based on the crimes committed. Upon the judgment of the Tribunal, Pact Legal representation may be available, or may be intentionally withheld, in accordance to the severity of the infractions, and level of punishment incurred.

3.4 Waiver of Punishment: For lesser transgressions, the Tribunal may judge that the punishment can be completely waived in exchange for restitution payment and donations. Should the member be unable to pay these fees, a contract of debt and schedule of payment or services will be created. This will maintain the member of the Pact as a member in good standing, and provide a method of ensuring positive outcomes despite minor infractions or honest mistakes.
