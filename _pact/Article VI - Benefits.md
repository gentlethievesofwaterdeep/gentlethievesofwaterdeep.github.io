# Article VI: Benefits

## 6.1 Asset Pool

The Pact shall maintain a pool of resources, including funds, equipment, safe houses, and contacts, to support its members in their endeavors. These resources shall be offered to members of the Pact as paid services, with all profits returning to the pool for ensuring better services.

## 6.2 Fair Distribution

Members shall have equal access to the services provided by the pact. Where there are constraints, priority shall be given to projects that align with the strategic objectives of the organization. All services will be available to all members, save situations of punishment as described earlier in this document.

## 6.3 Legal Services

Members in good standing will have representation afforded to them, with a complementary 23 Â½ minute consultation provided by legal services. We advise members against resisting arrest (aside from escape), as our friends in the court and watch can help drastically reduce punishments. The legal services provided by default will be the available pro-bono volunteers. Additional experienced council, more comfortable accommodations during incarceration, lighter sentencing, and additional benefits may be requested via contractual agreements with our legal services. Results are not guaranteed, as member actions can heavily reduce the ability of a lgal representative from ensuring the desired outcome.

Before arrest, attempt to get rid of any weapons or stolen goods upon your person. This may allow your crimes to be considered trespassing in the eyes of the court.

Our consul advises members do the following upon arrest:
- Be polite to the watch. Temperment can play a role in sentencing.
- Inform the guards you wish the Cereulean be informed of your arrest. Within two working days you will be assigned representation.
- Avoid violence with fellow prisoners.
- Say nothing until your complimentary consultation.

Failure to follow these procedures may result in the termination of complimentary legal services, or membership in the Pact. If a fine is levied, the Pact can offer a loan at its discretion. A tribunal may approve a loan of up to 50 gold pieces, or provide a recommendation to the council to exceed the limit. The council has no limits on loans.

## 6.4 Magical Services

The Pact will retain a repository of magical items senior members are allowed to rent out. A flat fee will be charged. If the item is not returned, the individual will be responsible for the cost of replacing the item. Alternatively, a similar item can be procured pending tribunal approval.

Additionally, secure communication can be arranged via our members proficent in magic. Sending and illusory scripts are available to our members for 100GP and 25GP. Arcane locks can also be arranged for 50GP per lock. Additional fees may be charged if the spells are required within 24 hours. If any members need a secure meeting and are concerned about evesdropping, our VIP room can be rented for 100GP for one hour. Naturally, messages to other members can be left at our bartender for free, but the Pact accepts no liability.

## 6.5 Optional Funds for Legal Services, Insurance, and Retirement

To ensure the best representation, our members should contribute at least 10GP a month to the legal services fund. As mentioned in 6.3, only the initial consultation is complimentary.

Additionally, our members may elect to contribute to a fund providing insurance in case of severe bodily harm. A tribunal will dictate if a member is elligible for a pay out. If said member is unable to return to their profession, the Pact will aid them in finding a new profession.

As many crimes require participants have good health, the council will provide a fund to allow our members a comfortable retirement. The council is expected to organize excursions to increase this fund, as well as use legitimate means. Our members should know information can often be more valuable than gemstones. Anyone who can aid this fund will be well compensated. Ideally, this fund will allow us a great deal of influence and legitimacy.
