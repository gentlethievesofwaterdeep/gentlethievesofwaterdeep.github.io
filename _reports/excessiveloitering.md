# Police Report: Case File #5723

## Reporting Officer
Officer Bumblebee Thistlefoot

## Date
 15th of Hammer, 1492 DR

## Incident
 Traffic Violation and Witness Testimony

## Suspect
 Green Dragonborn

## Name
Tau G'het (pronounced with a hard "H")

## Description
Male green dragonborn, approximately 36 years old, 6'5" tall, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit. Wearing a monocle and carrying a cane adorned with a faux-gold dragon head.

# Details of Incident
On the morning of the 15th of Hammer, while patrolling the streets of Waterdeep, I observed a violation of traffic regulations involving Tau G'het, who was loitering excessively in a no-parking zone near the Market Square. Despite repeated warnings to vacate the area, Tau G'het remained stationary, insisting that he was "contemplating the finer points of existence" and couldn't be bothered with trivial matters such as traffic laws.
After issuing a citation for the violation, Tau G'het begrudgingly moved his carriage, but not before expressing his displeasure with the "mundane bureaucracy" of law enforcement.

## Witness Testimony:

Name: Murgatroyd Snigglesnort

Statement: "Oh, yes, I saw the whole thing! Tau G'het, he's like a divine being, you know? So refined, so sophisticated. I was just on my way to join his cult, you see, when that dreadful traffic officer interrupted us. I mean, who does he think he is, disrupting the divine machinations of Tau G'het? It's a travesty, I tell you!"
Charges: Excessive loitering in a no-parking zone and failure to comply with a lawful order.
