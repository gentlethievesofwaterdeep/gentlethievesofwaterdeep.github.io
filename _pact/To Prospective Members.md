Potential Signatory,

I pen this missive to you with a sense of urgency and purpose, for within the words that follow lies an opportunity of unparalleled magnitude. I speak, of course, of the Cerulean Pact, a beacon of honor and cooperation amidst the murky waters of Waterdeep's criminal underworld.

We find ourselves amidst a storm of gang warfare, where violence and discord reign supreme. The streets are no longer safe, and the innocent suffer as power-hungry factions vie for control. Amidst the current chaos lies an opportunityâ€”a chance for a group of reasonable individuals to step forward and bring order to the chaos, to provide a stabilizing force that keeps violence to a minimum. Hence, the Pact. Our organization will move to fill the power vacuum in a way that benefits everyone in this city.

Allow me to further elucidate upon the virtues of this pact, and why I implore you, skilled thieves, forgers, lawyers, muscle, and other esteemed criminals, to affix your signature upon its sacred parchment.

First and foremost, let us speak of the code of honor that each signatory is expected to uphold. This code, born from the depths of my own wisdom, decrees that violence shall be eschewed whenever possible. Instead, we shall rely upon our wits and cunning to achieve our goals, demonstrating respect for our adversaries in the noble institution of the City Watch. Thus, we can offer an alternative to the brutality that currently plagues our city.

Furthermore, I have under my employ Tallir, the most formidable criminal defense lawyer in all of Waterdeep. From this day forth, he shall exclusively represent Pact signatories, ensuring that their legal rights are upheld and their interests fiercely defended.

But the benefits of joining the Cerulean Pact do not end there, my friends. Nay, for I have cultivated connections with a prominent mercenary group in the north, a distinguished noble house, and friends at sea who, I must stress, are certainly not pirates. Most importantly, I have numerous friends in the City Watch.

Through our combined efforts, we can guarantee preferential treatment for Pact members from the City Watch, ensuring that they receive the most comfortable cells, the finest prison fare, and lighter sentences for their transgressions.

Ah, but let us not forget our rivals, the odious Xanathar's Guild and the insidious Zhentarim. These wretched organizations pose a threat not only to the City Watch and the citizens of Waterdeep but to all respectable criminals such as ourselves. Xanathar's Guild, in particular, is far too violent, its leader a coward who hides behind a veil of anonymity, rarely deigning to meet with his own members. And don't even get me started on the hideous tattoo of eyes their members wear - an affront to good taste and decency!

As for the Zhentarim, they are too preoccupied with their regional ambitions and their silly civil war to focus solely on business within Waterdeep. And let us not forget the absurdity of their mascot - flying snakes! Truly, a more ridiculous choice could not be made, for snakes are universally recognized as symbols of deceit and treachery.

In conclusion, my dear colleagues, I urge you to seize this opportunity with both hands. Sign the Cerulean Pact, and know that you shall be welcomed into my fold as my whelps, to be protected and nurtured as my own kin. But heed this warning: regardless of the offer, regardless of the enticements laid before you, ensure that you properly pronounce the hard "H" in my name. For any mispronunciation shall be considered a grievous insult, one that I shall not soon forget.

With deepest regards and anticipation,

Tau G'het
