# To Our Partners

Attached is a preliminary copy of our rules for our new 'guild'. We look forward to your feedback, and hope you will sponsor respectable individuals once we formally create the pact.

We are in no rush to grow quickly, lest we run afoul of Xanathar's or the Zhentarim. In the meantime, there are a few goals we should strive towards to ensure we are prepared to rapidly grow once the power vaccuum opens.

## Short Term Goals

- The most important goal at this time to ensure we build a productive relationship with the city watch. We endeavor to remove Stagget from his post in the dock ward, and replace him with our good friend in the watch. We propose enticing Stagget into retirement, or getting him reassigned. A more detailed proposal will be discussed at our next meeting.
- Avoid confrontation with Xanathar's and the Zhentarim. As we endeavor to avoid violence, we are content at this time to have these two organizations fight one another. Given the reach of the Zhentarim, we may consider working with them in the future.
- Recruit and develop talent. Given our ties to the nobility of this city, training thieves and pickpockets on the finer points of ettiquite is prudent. We should teach our associates the most valuable thing in a noble's manor isn't gold or silver--it's their letters.
- Acquire magical items we can lend out to our members.
- Find clients in the nobility.

## Long Term Goals

- Ascertain the identity of masked lords. Our intent is not to blackmail these individuals, but to earn their support.
- Invest in legitimate enterprises. This will allow us to have more soft power than other criminal organizations. In the future, acquiring information to fuel these investments will be our primary goal for our members.
