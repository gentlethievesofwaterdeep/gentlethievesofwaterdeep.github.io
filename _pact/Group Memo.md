# Memo

Please review the attached document. We will be sending this out to our friends up north, the shopkeep, and our friend at the docks. Additionally, a copy will be sent to our friend in the watch. If anyone would like to reach out to other parties, please inform the unseen servants so they can arrange another copy.

After our job this week, we should expect to move quickly to recruit new talent. Enclosed is a tentative plan for our tasks afterwords.

## Tallir
Reach out to respectable associates, make it known that henceforth, Pact membership is required for clients. No exceptions will be made. (Our friends up north of course, can ignore this.)

## Tau G'het and Dastan
Begin networking with the noble class. When possible, bring along a member of the Pact along to inform them of the finer points of ettiquite.

## Toibin and Veltar
Scout potential members as they drop by the bar. See recruitment procedures for further information.

## Orp
At this time, we have not investigated the sewers. Given other criminals use the sewers to move goods and people discreetly, I propose Orp lead an effort to gain familiarity with the sewer system in our vicinity.
