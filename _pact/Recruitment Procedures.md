## On Recruitment

To ensure spies from Xanethar's and the Zhentarim are unable to join the Pact, we will establish the following procedure to vet prospective members.
- Toibin will be our initial scout given his job as bartender.
- If Toibin approves, a meeting will be arranged with the prospective member in our 'VIP room'.
- At a minimum, Toibin, Matthis, and Veltar should be present. One should assume the role of Tau G'het.
- Detect Thoughts will be cast, and after a couple of questions, we will inform the prospective member of this. Be prepared to detain them.
- Matthis, be it in the guise of Tau G'het or The Drow, will attempt to instill a respectful fear of Tau G'het. While we aim to avoid violence, we can use the threat of violence from the council.
- If we reveal the prospective member is a spy, we will block the exit back to the material plane, and deal with them. Sadly, violence is the language of Xanathar and the Zhentarim, so we must be fluent.
- Alternatively, we may 'suggest' a potential spy should repent, and immediatly turn themselves into the watch and give them a full list of their crimes.
