## Goals

## Background

- Dragon. Full dragon, expressing as a dragonborn. Tired of the hunt for wealth, get it from the source. The intrigue of
  underworld dealings
- uhh

## Connections

- The Drow: This is the most common pairing. The Drow serves as a general purpose henchman/valet. Source of amusement
  ("Frederick, stab yourself."), poison checker ("Filip, drink this."), and other actions. Dismissive, but keeps him
   close by. This pairing allows Tau to appear to be the level headed one, and force distraction to position himself to
   a location of safety or influence.
- The Lawyer: Occasionally relies on this persona for additional business acumen and providing a sense of stability.
- Cerulean: Initial poses as an investor in the pub. If a job goes sideways, this will be used as a cover for Tau's
  actions, allowing him to take on his intended role: A scape goat.

## Aliases
