Location: Baldur's Gate, Sword Coast

Reporting Officer: Detective Greyson, Baldur's Gate City Watch

Narrative:

At approximately 11:30 PM on Uktar 12, 1407, I was dispatched to investigate reports of a violent robbery at the Red Dragon Inn, a notorious tavern in the Lower City known for its association with criminal activities. Witnesses described the suspect as Triple T the drow, a known wizard with a penchant for chaos and troublemaking.

Upon arrival at the scene, I was met with a scene of utter chaos. The Red Dragon Inn was in disarray, with broken furniture, shattered glass, and bloodstains littering the floor. Patrons and staff were shaken and terrified, recounting the harrowing events that had unfolded.

According to eyewitness accounts, Triple T had stormed into the tavern accompanied by a gang of thugs, armed to the teeth and emanating an aura of dark magic. Flaunting his arcane powers, he announced his intention to take control of the establishment and establish himself as the new kingpin of the local drug trade.

In a brazen display of violence and intimidation, Triple T and his accomplices proceeded to rob the patrons at gunpoint, confiscating their valuables and demanding information about rival drug operations in the area. Those who dared to resist were subjected to vicious beatings and magical assaults, leaving several individuals with serious injuries.

As chaos reigned inside the tavern, Triple T's minions began to ransack the premises, seizing contraband substances and illicit goods hidden throughout the establishment.

Despite the best efforts of the Baldur's Gate City Watch, Triple T and his gang managed to escape the scene before reinforcements could arrive. However, through diligent investigation and cooperation with informants within the criminal underworld, we have been able to identify several suspects linked to the robbery, including Triple T himself, and his best friend Sir Snoutington the green dragonborn.

Based on the severity of the offenses committed, Triple T is wanted on charges of aggravated robbery, illegal drug trade, assault with a deadly weapon, and conspiracy to commit organized crime. Efforts are underway to apprehend him and dismantle his criminal enterprise before it can further destabilize the peace and security of Baldur's Gate.
