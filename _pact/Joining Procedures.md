## On members joining

To ensure spies are unable to join the Pact, we will establish the following procedure to vet prospective members.
- Toibin will be our initial scout as it's most likely they will approach him at the bar.
- If Toibin approves, a meeting will be arranged with the prospective member in our VIP room.
- At a minimum, Toibin, Matthis, and Veltar should be present. One should assume the role of Tau G'het.
- Detect Thoughts will be cast, and after a couple of questions, we will inform the prospective member of this, as they may panic.
- Matthis, be it in the guise of Tau G'het or The Drow, will attempt to instill a respectful fear of Tau G'het. While we aim to avoid violence, we can use the threat of violence from the council.
- If Detect Thoughts reveals the prospective member is a spy, we will block the exit back to the material plane, and deal with them. Sadly, violence is the language of Xanathar and the Zhentarim, so we should speak a bit of it as well.
