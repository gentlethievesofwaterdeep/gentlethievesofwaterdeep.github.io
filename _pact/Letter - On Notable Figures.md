Esteemed comrades,

Let us delve deeper into the diverse cast of characters that surrounds us, for in their individuality lies our collective strength and intrigue.

In the grand tapestry of our organization, each member plays a crucial role, contributing their unique talents and expertise to our noble cause. Allow me to shed light on the esteemed individuals who stand beside us in our pursuit of greatness.

First and foremost, we have Dastan Phylund, whose noble lineage and prowess in combat serve as a bridge to the aristocracy of Waterdeep. House Phylund's expertise in taming dangerous monsters shall undoubtedly prove invaluable as we endeavor to tame the criminal underworld.

Next, the enigmatic genius of Orp, the grung whose insights are as mysterious as they are unfailingly accurate. It bears repeating that Orp is unequivocally not a frog, despite any misconceptions to the contrary. His guidance is a beacon of clarity in the murky depths of our endeavors.

We then have Veltar, a skilled drow wizard whose mastery of the arcane arts is not to be underestimated. While he may arrange secure communications and other magical services, one cannot help but wish for a more refined stabbing technique. Alas, he pales in comparison to the unparalleled prowess of my faithful manservant, Triple T, 3T, or ZZ, whose loyalty and dedication know no bounds.

Let us address Mathis, the bard whose talents, though undoubtedly impressive to some, leave me decidedly unimpressed. One cannot help but be condescending towards bards in general, though I begrudgingly admit that Mathis is at least marginally more skilled than that ginger upstart Kvothe.

It is with a heavy heart, however, that I introduce Toibin, the bartender who made the unfortunate choice to adorn his locks in a shade of blue. Oh, how I lament this misguided preference, for green, my dear companions, is unquestionably the most noble of colors. It represents the very essence of life, growth, and prosperity, embodying the natural beauty that surrounds us. Despite this lamentable flaw, Toibin is undeniably an excellent bartender, and I hold out hope that perhaps one day he shall see the error of his ways and dye his hair green, aligning himself with the true virtue of our cause.

Together, we shall navigate the treacherous waters of the criminal underworld, guided by the wisdom of Orp, the strength of Dastan, the melodies of Mathis, and the libations of Toibin.

In conclusion, my dear allies, I implore you to consider the virtues of green and the symbolism it represents. Let us embrace the noble color as a mark of our unity and commitment to our cause. I encourage each and every one of you to dye your hair green, joining us in our quest for greatness.

With deepest regards,

Tau G'het
