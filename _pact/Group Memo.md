# Memo

Please review the attached documentation. We will be sending this out to our friends up north, the shopkeep, and our friend at the docks. A copy will be sent to our friend in the watch. If anyone would like to reach out to other parties, please inform the unseen servants so they can arrange a copy.

After our job this week, we should expect to move quickly to recruit new talent. Enclosed is a tentative plan for our tasks afterwords.

## Tallir
Reach out to respectable associates, make it known that Pact membership is required for clients. (This of course, does not extent to our northern friend and his associates.)

## Tau G'het and Dastan
Begin networking amgongst the noble class. When possible, bring a member of the pact along to inform them of the finer points of ettiquite.

## Toibin and Veltar
Scout potential members as they drop by the bar. Magic should be used to confirm prospective members are not aligned with our rivals.

## Orp
At this time, we have not investigated the sewers. Given other criminals use the sewers to move goods and people discreetly, I propose Orp lead an effort to gain familiarity with the sewer system in our vicinity.
