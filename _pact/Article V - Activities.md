# Article V: Activities

## 5.1 Code of Conduct

While the Pact operates outside the bounds of conventional law, members are expected to adhere to a code of conduct. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Refraining from excessive bodily harm to individuals.
- Avoiding actions that may bring undue harm to society at large.
- Respecting the secrecy of fellow signed parties.
- Associating with known enemies of the Pact.
- Intetionally interfering with the business of a Pact member or ally.
- Disrespectful behavior towards leadership and senior members.
- Excessive activites aimed at the lower class.
- Participanting in crimital activity in the vicinity of our headquarters.
- Targetting influential members of the nobility or other protected parties without tribunal approval.
- Bringing harm to a member of the watch, a magistrate, or their immediate kin.
- Engaging in grossly unprofessional behavior. We are not ruffians who get into bar fights numerous times in a week.

We may be criminals, but we are professional criminals. The rest of Article V describes the code of conduct in further detail.

## 5.2 Non-Violent Crimes

Members of The Pact shall primarily engage in non-violent criminal activities, including but not limited to theft, burglary, fraud, forgery, information brokerage, and smuggling. Any activities involving excessive violence or endangerment of innocent lives are prohibited.

## 5.3 Secrecy

Members shall conduct their operations with utmost discretion, avoiding unnecessary attention and minimizing the risk of exposure. The Pact shall maintain secure communication channels and employ encryption methods to safeguard sensitive information.

## 5.4 Activities Targeting Members

Membership within the Pact is a matter of record. As such, it is expected that one should refrain from taking action against or targeting another member of the Pact. Disputes should be mediated by a tribunal.

## 5.5 Allies

Allies are generally considered as "Pact Members" for the sake of activities targeting them. As alliances can be in a state of flux, it is considered a best practice to consult a tribunal prior to taking any action that could be considered as targeting an ally or their interests. Any action taken against an ally without tribunal permission will be considered a punishable offence. Any action taken against an ally with tribunal permission that is determined incorrect will be considered a punishable offence for the members of that tribunal, and not the member who acted in accordance to the rules set here.

## 5.6 Unaligned Factions

Throughout this item, remember the Zhentarim and Xanathar guilds, who we currently consider as "enemies". This is made explicit for emphasis: We are not them, and refuse to act as they do. Their blood feud inhibits the interests of all criminals in Waterdeep. Our goal is not to conquer, defeat, or impair them. It is to be better, and create a reliable flow of work. Given the opportunity to take action specifically targeting another faction, whether it is the named factions above or another one, it is strictly advised to avoid such an activity. Turf wars do nothing but rob all of us of the opportunities that this city creates. When planning such an activity, consider the implications to other factions. When in doubt, consult a tribunal for guidance.

## 5.7 Innocents and the Working Class

To those who have little, much is owed. The nature of the oppressed working class is such to provide a rich network of information. We are to be the rising tide that lifts all boats. Any activities taken against the lower classes of Waterdeep may be considered for tribunal review, depending on the scale of the activities taken.

## 5.8 Nobility and Aristocrats

While the nobility may be a lucrative target, they are also a fickle one that can cause lasting repercussions. Consider your actions against them carefully. Activities taken against this class on their properties without consultation of a tribunal will be a punishable offence. Such a tribunal should have a senior member familiar with the nobility present. This is not meant to deter signed parties from targeting the nobility. Instead, a tribunal should be viewed as an opportunity to learn more about the target(s). Opportunistic activities targeting influential members of this class may be considered for tribunal review.

## 5.8.1 Contracts for Nobility

The leadership council can authorize specific contracts targeting nobles. These cases will be considered individually, and do not fall under the general protections for nobility.

## 5.8.2 Special Protections

The leadership council will maintain a publicly posted list of protected families and parties. Activities targeting these listed entities will be considered punishable, irregardless of circumstance.

## 5.9 The Watch, Magisters and Judges

At all times, active members of the watch, as well as the judiciary and their immediate families are to be considered off limits and invalid targets of activities. No tribunal may determine that a judicial member is a valid target. Any member of the Pact that knowingly targets a member of the watch or judicial branch will be immediately considered for tribunal punishment.

## 5.9.1 Honest Mistakes

If a tribunal judges that an honest mistake was made by the offending member in the matter of an activity targeting a member of the watch or judicial system, then the punishment may be completely waived in exchange for restitution payment and donations, as recommended by Article III.
