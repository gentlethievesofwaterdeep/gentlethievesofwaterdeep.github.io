Narrative:

At approximately 1:00 PM on Nightal 27, 1353, I, Detective Blackthorn of the Baldur's Gate City Watch, received reports of a violent robbery at the bustling Farmer's Market in the Lower City. Witnesses described the suspect as a drow wizard with a rather peculiar alias - Zucchini Zapper.

Upon arrival at the scene, I found chaos unfolding amidst the market stalls. Shouts and screams filled the air as patrons and vendors scrambled to evade the onslaught of magical fruit projectiles being launched by Zucchini Zapper. The drow wizard appeared to be wielding his arcane powers to transform innocent fruits into dangerous weapons.

According to eyewitness accounts, Zucchini Zapper had barged into the market brandishing his wand and demanding access to the finest fruits available. When his demands were refused by the vendors, he unleashed a torrent of magically enhanced fruit, pelting them with a variety of produce ranging from oversized grapes to exploding coconuts.

In his frenzy, Zucchini Zapper targeted both patrons and vendors indiscriminately, causing injuries and panic among the crowd. Several individuals were struck by flying fruit and required medical attention for their injuries, while others fled the scene in fear for their safety.

Despite the best efforts of the City Watch to intervene and apprehend the suspect, Zucchini Zapper proved to be a formidable adversary, using his magical abilities to evade capture and continue his rampage through the market. His actions resulted in significant property damage and disruption to the livelihoods of the vendors.
