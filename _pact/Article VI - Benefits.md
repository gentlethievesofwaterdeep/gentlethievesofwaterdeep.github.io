# Article VI: Benefits

## 6.1 Asset Pool

The Pact shall maintain a pool of resources, including funds, equipment, safe houses, and contacts, to support its members in their endeavors. These resources shall be offered to members of the Pact as paid services, with all profits returning to the pool for ensuring better services.

## 6.2 Fair Distribution

Members shall have equal access to the services provided by the pact. Where there are constraints, priority shall be given to projects that align with the strategic objectives of the organization. All services will be available to all members, save situations of punishment as described earlier in this document.

## 6.3 Legal Services

Members in good standing will have an attorney afforded to them, with a complementary 23 ½ minute consultation provided by Pact Legal Services. We advise members against resisting arrest (aside from escape), as our friends in the court and watch can help drastically reduce punishments. The legal services provided by default will be the available pro-bono volunteers. Additional experienced council, more comfortable accommodations during incarceration, lighter sentencing, and additional benefits may be requested via contractual agreements with Pact Legal Services. Results are not guaranteed, as member actions can heavily reduce the ability of a Pact Legal representative from ensuring the desired outcome.

Our consul advises members do the following upon arrest:
- Be polite to the watch. Temperment can play a role in sentencing.
- Inform the guards you wish the Cereulean be informed of your arrest. Within two working days you will be assigned an attorney.
- Avoid violence with fellow prisoners.
- Say nothing until your complimentary consultation.

Failure to follow these procedures may result in the termination of complimentary legal services, or membership in the Pact. If a fine is levied, the Cereulean may offer a loan.
## 6.4 Insurance and Retirement
